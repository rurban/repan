# REPAN (Regular Expression Pattern Analyzer)

The aim of the repan project is to perform various tasks
on regular expressions except pattern matching. Repan
can parse various regular expression flavors, can analyze
or optimize them, and can construct new pcre patterns which
match to the same strings as the original patterns.
